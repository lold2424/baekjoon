### 문제 설명

<p>Little Ivica received N math grades and wants to calculate their average. He knows that the average of two numbers a and b is calculated as (a + b) / 2, but he still doesn’t know how to do it for multiple numbers. He calculates the average by writing down N grades and repeating the following operations N - 1 times:</p>

<ol>
	<li>He chooses two numbers and erases them.</li>
	<li>He writes down the average of the two chosen numbers.</li>
</ol>

<p>After precisely N - 1 steps, the only number written down will be the one representing the average grade to Ivica. It is your task to determine the largest average that can be obtained this way.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line of input contains the integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 20), the number from the task.</p>

<p>The i<sup>th</sup> of the following N lines contains the integer X<sub>i</sub> (1 ≤ X<sub>i</sub> ≤ 5), the i<sup>th</sup> grade.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>Output the largest possible average from the task. Your solution is allowed to deviate from the official one for 0.000001.</p>
