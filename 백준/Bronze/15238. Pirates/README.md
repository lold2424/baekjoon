### 문제 설명

<p>Pirates talk a funny way. They say word where the letters are repeated more than they need to be. We would like know which letter appears the most frequently in a Pirate word.</p>

<p>For example: In the word “arrrrrghh”, the letter “r” appears 5 times while “h” appears twice.</p>

<p>Write a program that reads a pirate word from the terminal and writes the letter that occurs most frequently.</p>

<p>It is guaranteed that only one letter is the most repeated. That is, words like “aipo” won’t appear because no single letter wins.</p>

### 입력 

 <p dir="ltr">The input will consist of two lines.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The first line will contain the size of the word and the second the word to process.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The word will only contain lowercase letters from a to z. The size of the word will be at most 1000 characters. No spaces or other symbols will appear.</p>

### 출력 

 <p dir="ltr">Print a single line with the character that appears the most and the number of occurrences.</p>
